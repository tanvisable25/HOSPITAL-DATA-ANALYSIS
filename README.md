# HOSPITAL-DATA-ANALYSIS
Hospital Data Analysis Power BI Project

⭐ Situation:
The hospital management team needed a clear overview of hospital operations, patient admissions, treatments, and discharge rates to improve service quality and operational efficiency.

⭐ Task:
Analyze hospital performance data to identify trends in patient flow, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization, and visualize them using Power BI dashboards.

⭐ Action:
Cleaned and structured raw hospital data, built data models in Power BI, used DAX functions to calculate KPIs such as total patients, admission rate, and average treatment time, and designed an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.

⭐ Result:
Delivered an insightful Power BI dashboard that improved hospital decision-making by providing a clear view of patient trends, treatment performance, and overall operational efficiency.

📄 Project Overview

The Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard project aims to visualize hospital performance metrics, patient records, and treatment outcomes using Power BI. The dashboard helps hospital administrators monitor daily operations, enhance efficiency, and identify improvement areas in patient care.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient admissions, discharges, and treatments across departments.

Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total patients, average stay duration, and treatment success rate.

Identify trends in patient flow, seasonal demand, and resource usage.

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven hospital management.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Power BI – For interactive dashboard and visualization

Power Query – For data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated KPIs and measures

Excel / CSV – For raw data collection and preprocessing

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data Preparation: Cleaned hospital data by removing duplicates and standardizing columns.

Data Transformation: Used Power Query to create relationships between patient, department, and treatment tables.

Dashboard Design: Developed interactive visualizations such as cards, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent KPIs and patient trends.

Insight Extraction: Applied filters and slicers to dynamically analyze data by department, doctor, or time period.

📊 Key Insights

Identified departments with the highest admission and discharge rates.

Analyzed average treatment time and patient satisfaction trends.

Discovered seasonal peaks in hospital visits.

Improved hospital efficiency through data-driven decisions and real-time monitoring.

🏁 Conclusion

This Power BI project transformed raw hospital data into meaningful insights that enhanced operational efficiency, patient care, and management decisions. The interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool for hospital administrators to track and optimize performance.
